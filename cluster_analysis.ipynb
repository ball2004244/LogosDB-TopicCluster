It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff. It is found in most gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some ice cream, dip and yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand. Pectin (from Ancient Greek: &#960;&#951;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; p&#275;ktiks, congealed, curdled[1]) is a structural heteropolysaccharide contained in the primary cell walls of terrestrial plants. It was first isolated and described in 1825 by Henri Braconnot.[2] It is produced commercially as a white to light brown powder, mainly extracted from citrus fruits, and is used in food as a gelling agent particularly in jams and jellies. It is also used in fillings, medicines, sweets, as a stabilizer in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of dietary fiber.', ['kw1', 'kw2', 'kw3', 'kw4', 'kw5'])\n",

Palm sugar is from a different type of palm (although still not the variety of palm from which palm oil is procured), but is processed in the same way.

Here, since someone actually did track down the relevant manufacturer's information, one is not likely to encounter any unpleasant surprises. Still, my suggestion is that if you have any hesitation or suspicions whatsoever, it might be wiser to select an alternative. The web site sales pitch quoted above by C. Bandi, for all it's bland, reassuring generalities about all natural xanthan gum, never explicitly states that this is not the variety of xanthan cultured from wheat. I'd feel a whole lot better about it if the package simply label stated Gluten-Free in bold type. While the Material Safety Data Sheet provides a super-abundance of data, it avoids ever specifying where this product is made. Most often, that omission indicates made in China, where lax inspections have been known to allow dry wall plaster to be packaged as infant formula. (!!!) Elsewhere in the Safety Data Sheet, the manufacturer specifies at least twice that Food Grade designation in no way implies that the product is safe for human consumption. They only commit to 95% purity and furthermore--besides allowing that gastro-intestinal distress is possible--the makers caution, for example, that one needs to wear safety glasses with side shields when handling the product among other dire-sounding warnings. No independent testing laboratory is mentioned. We are asked to take the company's word for everything, and even then they deny any and all responsibility for the product's purity or safety. Sure, all those disclaimers are there to protect the manufacturer from any product liability, but glancing through the material was enough to convince me to keep looking for another option, ideally one from a better known source not so coy about where the stuff comes from. True, this product is less expensive per ounce than widely trusted brands, but only a small amount of the substance is needed to hold a wheat-free batter or dough together, and for the ordinary home baker, an entire pound could easily outlast the product's stamped expiration date. On the listing for Bob's Red Mill Xanthan, an enthusiastic baker reports 8 ounces ( pound) to be a generous supply for six months. If for peace of mind alone, I'm choosing a different brand.\", ['kw1', 'kw2', 'kw3', 'kw4', 'kw5'])\n",

What I also did was send the website www.senecafoods.com a e-mail asking if this product is non-gmo. I should get an answer back within two days. What does the label ORGANIC mean to you? Organic refers not only to the food itself, but also to how it was produced. Foods labeled organic must be certified under the National Organic Program (NOP), which took effect October 21, 2002. Despite rigid organic certification procedures, organic certification is about the *process* of growing food, not about the actual resulting food. There is no required testing process for organic ingredients. The NOP regulations prohibit the use of genetically modified organisms, prohibit commingling or contamination during processing and handling, and require preventative practices to avoid contact with GMOs. Organic agricultural products should have minimal if any GMO contaminants; however, organic food products do not have a zero tolerance for the presence of GMO material and remember, there is no required testing process for organic ingredients. In addition, the USDA oversight of organic food has been lax since the program was launched in 2002. It can take nearly three years for a manufacturer who illegally uses the term organic in their labeling to be noticed, reported, investigated, and forced to amend their label. The oversight of organic manufacturers falls short of assuring standards are met. Once again, buyer beware- shop locally whenever possible and support manufacturers who are dedicated to ingredient integrity. Currently, there are three organic labels classifications: 100% Organic: Must contain 100% organically produced ingredients (excluding water and salt). This is the only label that certifies a completely organic product AND completely GMO-free ingredients. Certified Organic / USDA Organic / Organic: At least 95% of content is organic by weight (excluding water and salt). The National List. GMOs are NOT on this list, so these products are also usually GMO-free. Made with Organic: Up to 70% of the ingredients are organic. These products can NOT carry a USDA organic label and are NOT typically GMO-free.\", ['kw1', 'kw2', 'kw3', 'kw4', 'kw5'])\n",

They (Amazon & other marketplace sellers of products) have always done this for MANY, many reasons! It's all a pricing game! Just watch the price and when it drops to a point you are comfortable with, BUY IT!! Here are some tips that will make this a LOT easier to accomplish.... from a veteran Amazon shopper: 1. Go to www.camelcamel.com and register for CamelCamel, which is an Amazon price tracker that will show you price history charts for all Amazon items (so you can see when the best time to buy that item is over time). It has price watches and PRICE DROP ALERTS. Once you register, you can set up price value alerts for everything in your Amazon Wish List. It will automatically e-mail you when the price drops to a certain point (you decide) for any particular item, for whatever value you set for it (%age wise or dollar amount)!! Prices often drop to their lowest point at odd hours of the day and night (perhaps when Amazon traffic is at a lull) and usually only for a very brief period of time, so you have to act quickly (especially if it's on Black Friday)! 2. Remember that you can set up as many Wish Lists as you want, and can even categorize/name them different things, such as Grocery Items, Clothing, Household Products, etc., to help you sort all the items you are price-watching. Amazon doesn't currently have a way to sort or filter items in your Save for later cart. My Save for Later cart has 30+ pages and it's very difficult to find an item that I added a long time ago, without having to go through each page to find it! 3. Download the price tracking add-on for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome called Camelizer, which makes it easy to view the price history of any product sold by their supported retailers. View Camel price history charts WITHOUT leaving the retailer product page/website. 4. Save even more money by downloading PriceBlink, a Firefox Add-On that automatically finds lower prices and money-saving coupons from thousands of retailers while you shop. Stays hidden until you are on a product website. Automatically gives you a Price Comparison (as well as pricing history & Coupons too!) with a dropdown box at the top of your screen.

Two ingredients: Erythritol & Luo Han Guo (Monk Fruit) Both are zero on glycemic index.

Erythritol, a type of sugar alcohol, is absorbed into your blood stream, but does not readily enter any of your body's cells and is usually excreted through your urine. It does not tend to cause gastric distress like Sorbitol, Xylitol or particularly Malitol.

Saves money using some Stevia (the Lakanto is quite expensive but great stuff). Stevia in the Raw brand is more expensive than the Great Value. Also it has Dextrose and Maltodextrin listed in the ingredients. Bad stuff. Dextrose is simply a form of glucose. Maltodextrin is a GMO corn derivative with an extremely high glycemic index of 150 produced from rice, potato or corn starch. It is known to contain MSG and it doesn't need to state that on the ingredient label. Monk Fruit in the Raw also has either Dextrose or Maltodextrin or both.

How often depends on the time of year, I let the soil dry out a little on top between waterings so it's evenly moist but never soggy. I like to water it with a liquid fertilizer every other month or so and about once a year I will put the plant in the sink or shower pot and all and water it really good- let the fresh water flow through. This will leach out the salt buildup. Dont do this often though, just when you see salty deposits build up around the drain holes is how you know it's time.
