necklace aliens from planet pittsburg how two young roboticists from carnegie mellon pioneered digital lighting    education    george attended carnegie mellon university school of engineering and graduated in 1993 with a degree in computer and electrical engineering at cmu he met dr ihor lys also an engineering student they struck a fast friendship and their connection was a harbinger of what was to later become a worldchanging partnership    career     isi  upon graduating carnegie mellon university in 1994 george and his brother gary formed internet securities inc isi the company aggregated economic and corporate data in developing economies from offices in 29 countries across the americas africa asia the middle east and europe the company grew to 350 employees and was sold to euromoney plc  in 1999 for 50m  color kinetics    while involved in isi george and lys partnered to form color kinetics incorporated with gary as their first investor  george had roles in both companies but in 1998 left isi to focus his efforts and attention on color kinetics while gary continued to run isi   color kinetics capitalized on the nascent solid state lighting ssl technology that with the advent of blue leds and exponential improvements in output had become viable for uses beyond indicator lights mueller and lys were able to develop and bring to market many uses for led technology that had previously been unavailable both in commercial and residential settings they were the first to create white light with leds through additive color mixing blending the output of red green and blue rgb it was this development and their securing of the intellectual property around it that made leds primed for the replacement of the incandescent bulb the prevailing technology of the era and made color kinetics an extremely valuable company   the company developed numerous products for entertainment municipal and architectural uses and stewarded multiple generations of improvements in the technology starting from small color changing lights in 1997 to entertainment units for arenas and stadiums to the bay lights by leo villareal which at the time was the worlds largest led installation covering the entire western facing expanse of the bay bridge from san francisco to treasure island in addition to the flexibility and long lamp life that leds embodied millions and millions of tons of carbon emissions have been saved over the last two decades on the basis of muellers and lys work a fact that mueller was particularly proud of   color kinetics was a pioneer in taking leds from a novelty item to the mainstream of illumination  and the companys developments in solid state lighting changed the way humans interact with light the switch to leds also enabled a significant reduction in the required level of power consumption to create usable levels of illumination   the company grew to 350 employees and 100 million in sales but it was the extensive intellectual property that mueller and lys secured that made the company exponentially more valuable than a usual ebitda multiple    ecosense korrus  after the sale of color kinetics the groundwork was laid for muellers next venture in the lighting field ecosense now korrus ecosense deployed the now more mature white led technology with improved power supplies and a focus on modular design for linear and cove lighting applications their capability to rapidly configure and ship a vast array of light configurations further enabled ecosense to light beautiful major projects around the world later developments centered around understanding how light affects our natural circadian rhythms and creating healthy lighting the human body operates on a predictable cycle or time clock and environmental cues or zeitgebers the most significant of which is light resets that clock  historically the sun provided humans with a steady and predictable zeitgeber delivering the right light at the right time to continuously keep circadian clocks in sync this syncedup state known as circadian entrainment relies on photoreceptors in our eyes called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells iprgcs iprgcs transform incoming light into signals which are then sent to multiple regions of the brain chief among these regions is the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn the bodys master clock and the heart of the circadian system to put it simply iprgcs utilize light to keep the circadian clock on time  korrus has developed technology to produce healthy light whether in displays screens or fixtures korrus uses spectral agility to separate the visual experience from the beneficial properties of light the technology korrus created enables consistent white light for vision while manipulating its underlying composition to support circadian health  korrus is pioneering a field called human light interaction   robot heart    in 2005 mueller first went to burning man with friend and architect walt smith and they camped with an established group called disorient mueller left disorient and founded robot heart in 2008 bringing together a collective of doers and dreamers artists and entrepreneurs it was the fusion of georges fierce desire to create a sense of community along with his passion for light and music    robot heart is most widely known for its iconic 1972 leyland double decker bus that was modified to have tens of thousands of watts of highquality audio and an expansive led heart sitting atop the bus would drive to the deep playa and throw parties far outside of black rock city these parties quickly became legendary and djs from around the world would come to burning man to play the bus  free of charge  to any and all participants at burning man these soundcloud sets including one of muellers favorites and the last set he listened to above  beyond with elena brower are memorialized online and accessible to all    robot heart events have expanded beyond the reaches of the burning man community and have become widely known in many parts of the globe what mueller may be most known for amongst his friends is the community he built around robot heart and the indelible impact that this community has had on so many others robot heart participated in the 2021freeburn in part a memorial to its founder and continues to this day the robot heart foundation is preparing its formal launch in new york the weekend of april 29 through may 1st the spirit of mueller is arguably most alive through the community he created with his friends how burning mans famed robot heart camp is carrying on after the death of founder george mueller  further future  mueller along with other members of robot heart created further future a transformational festival held in southern nevada in 2015 and 2016 the further future model was a shared experience thats beyond our future and promised a carefully curated slate of business and cultural leaders chefs mixologists and masseuses further future located on the moapa band of paiute indians aspired to be a gathering of people with the common goal to spend time together celebrating the infinite possibilities of the future without necessarily being shackled to the dictates of the past or the cycles of presentday society the invitationonly festival for as many as 5000 people ran from april 29 to may 1 in 2015 and 2016  personal life  georges life partner was ting ji and the couple had two children together astro ji mueller january 7 2017 and xing ji mueller march 29 2019  references

necklace aliens from planet pittsburg how two young roboticists from carnegie mellon pioneered digital lighting    education    george attended carnegie mellon university school of engineering and graduated in 1993 with a degree in computer and electrical engineering at cmu he met dr ihor lys also an engineering student they struck a fast friendship and their connection was a harbinger of what was to later become a worldchanging partnership    career     isi  upon graduating carnegie mellon university in 1994 george and his brother gary formed internet securities inc isi the company aggregated economic and corporate data in developing economies from offices in 29 countries across the americas africa asia the middle east and europe the company grew to 350 employees and was sold to euromoney plc  in 1999 for 50m  color kinetics    while involved in isi george and lys partnered to form color kinetics incorporated with gary as their first investor  george had roles in both companies but in 1998 left isi to focus his efforts and attention on color kinetics while gary continued to run isi   color kinetics capitalized on the nascent solid state lighting ssl technology that with the advent of blue leds and exponential improvements in output had become viable for uses beyond indicator lights mueller and lys were able to develop and bring to market many uses for led technology that had previously been unavailable both in commercial and residential settings they were the first to create white light with leds through additive color mixing blending the output of red green and blue rgb it was this development and their securing of the intellectual property around it that made leds primed for the replacement of the incandescent bulb the prevailing technology of the era and made color kinetics an extremely valuable company   the company developed numerous products for entertainment municipal and architectural uses and stewarded multiple generations of improvements in the technology starting from small color changing lights in 1997 to entertainment units for arenas and stadiums to the bay lights by leo villareal which at the time was the worlds largest led installation covering the entire western facing expanse of the bay bridge from san francisco to treasure island in addition to the flexibility and long lamp life that leds embodied millions and millions of tons of carbon emissions have been saved over the last two decades on the basis of muellers and lys work a fact that mueller was particularly proud of   color kinetics was a pioneer in taking leds from a novelty item to the mainstream of illumination  and the companys developments in solid state lighting changed the way humans interact with light the switch to leds also enabled a significant reduction in the required level of power consumption to create usable levels of illumination   the company grew to 350 employees and 100 million in sales but it was the extensive intellectual property that mueller and lys secured that made the company exponentially more valuable than a usual ebitda multiple    ecosense korrus  after the sale of color kinetics the groundwork was laid for muellers next venture in the lighting field ecosense now korrus ecosense deployed the now more mature white led technology with improved power supplies and a focus on modular design for linear and cove lighting applications their capability to rapidly configure and ship a vast array of light configurations further enabled ecosense to light beautiful major projects around the world later developments centered around understanding how light affects our natural circadian rhythms and creating healthy lighting the human body operates on a predictable cycle or time clock and environmental cues or zeitgebers the most significant of which is light resets that clock  historically the sun provided humans with a steady and predictable zeitgeber delivering the right light at the right time to continuously keep circadian clocks in sync this syncedup state known as circadian entrainment relies on photoreceptors in our eyes called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells iprgcs iprgcs transform incoming light into signals which are then sent to multiple regions of the brain chief among these regions is the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn the bodys master clock and the heart of the circadian system to put it simply iprgcs utilize light to keep the circadian clock on time  korrus has developed technology to produce healthy light whether in displays screens or fixtures korrus uses spectral agility to separate the visual experience from the beneficial properties of light the technology korrus created enables consistent white light for vision while manipulating its underlying composition to support circadian health  korrus is pioneering a field called human light interaction   robot heart    in 2005 mueller first went to burning man with friend and architect walt smith and they camped with an established group called disorient mueller left disorient and founded robot heart in 2008 bringing together a collective of doers and dreamers artists and entrepreneurs it was the fusion of georges fierce desire to create a sense of community along with his passion for light and music    robot heart is most widely known for its iconic 1972 leyland double decker bus that was modified to have tens of thousands of watts of highquality audio and an expansive led heart sitting atop the bus would drive to the deep playa and throw parties far outside of black rock city these parties quickly became legendary and djs from around the world would come to burning man to play the bus  free of charge  to any and all participants at burning man these soundcloud sets including one of muellers favorites and the last set he listened to above  beyond with elena brower are memorialized online and accessible to all    robot heart events have expanded beyond the reaches of the burning man community and have become widely known in many parts of the globe what mueller may be most known for amongst his friends is the community he built around robot heart and the indelible impact that this community has had on so many others robot heart participated in the 2021freeburn in part a memorial to its founder and continues to this day the robot heart foundation is preparing its formal launch in new york the weekend of april 29 through may 1st the spirit of mueller is arguably most alive through the community he created with his friends how burning mans famed robot heart camp is carrying on after the death of founder george mueller  further future  mueller along with other members of robot heart created further future a transformational festival held in southern nevada in 2015 and 2016 the further future model was a shared experience thats beyond our future and promised a carefully curated slate of business and cultural leaders chefs mixologists and masseuses further future located on the moapa band of paiute indians aspired to be a gathering of people with the common goal to spend time together celebrating the infinite possibilities of the future without necessarily being shackled to the dictates of the past or the cycles of presentday society the invitationonly festival for as many as 5000 people ran from april 29 to may 1 in 2015 and 2016  personal life  georges life partner was ting ji and the couple had two children together astro ji mueller january 7 2017 and xing ji mueller march 29 2019  references

global governing bodies have attempted to regulate the esports space such as the esports integrity commission they have largely been unsuccessful  background  esports are individuals teams playing organized competitive video games at a professional level similar to traditional sports professional esports players are often contracted by esports organizations to compete in leagues and tournaments there is a wide variety of video game genres associated with esports such as firstperson shooters multiplayer online battle arenas mobas and sports video games some esports events pull in millions of viewers and while fans can watch esports events through broadcasts on platforms such as twitch and espn some events can be attended live at arenas prize money is often paid to the topplacing teams at these tournaments for example in 2021 dota 2 the international had a prize pool of over  with the possibility of financial gain players have an incentive to cheat  esports specific regulation  unlike traditional major league sports such as association footballs fifa and american footballs nfl esports is not centralized under a single organization while these traditional sports leagues are selfregulated and governed by relevant statutes case law and national or state regulations esports is largely unregulated in many countries esports is not recognized as a sport and therefore general regulation becomes difficult for any video game title tournament organizers generally provide their own set of rules subject to the video games developers there are two types of entities that regulate esports competitions gameneutral entities and gamespecific entities gameneutral entities such as the world esports association wesa the esports integrity commission esic the international esports federation iesf and the electronic sports league esl are entities that enforce policies over a variety of esports titles while these bodies have attempted to regulate the esports industry they have largely been unsuccessful as of 2019 esic is the leading regulatory body on enforcing ethics in esports however it is not universally adopted as leagues do not have to be a part of esic in order of magnitude they consider software cheats online attacks match fixing and doping as the most significant forms of cheating gamespecific entities are entities that enforce policies over a single esports title and are usually controlled by that games publisher examples include the overwatch league the league of legends championship series and the call of duty league  types of cheating  cheating in esports is divided into two categories cheating to win and cheating to lose cheating to win is the attempt to secure a win over an opposing player or team through illegitimate means common forms of this type of cheating are using software cheats online attacks and doping on the other hand cheating to lose is the concept of intentionally underperforming or losing a match usually for financial gain this can be done in several ways such as match fixing corrupting officials and technicians spotfixing and manipulating tournament structures    cheating to win   software cheats  esports players can gain an advantage by using unauthorized software such as an aimbot  software that automatically targets opponents faster and more accurately than most humans can most esports servers have builtin anticheat software that attempt to prevent cheating an example of a player using software assistance is counterstrike global offensive csgo player xektor who performed extremely well during german esl pro series online matches however during inperson events his performance fell off significantly members of the esl reviewed analytics from his replay data to determine that he was using an aimbot and wallhacks during the online matches and he was banned for two years his team took esl to the district court of cologne and while the court did not make a statement on whether xektor cheated or not they did determine that the measures esl took were appropriate software cheats are not exclusive to online play however on october 19 2018 csgo player nikhil forsaken kumawat was caught using an aimbot at the extremesland zowie asia csgo 2018 tournament in shanghai when a tournament administrator began to examine kumawats computer kumawat apparently attempted to brush aside the administrator and delete the hack following his team optic india was disqualified from the event and disbanded altogether esic required esl india to provide conclusive evidence of cheating and after esl reviewed kumawats play from a previous tournament the india premiership fall finals they determined had he had cheated in both events esic banned kumawat for five years  hardware cheats  generally tournament organizers will restrict the type of hardware that players are allowed to use many tournaments allow players to bring their own mouse and keyboard to an event allowing the possibility of a player using an unauthorized piece of equipment for example peruvian dota 2 team thunder predator was disqualified from the international 2018 after it was revealed that atn one of their players programmed macro commands into his mouse in a qualifying match on june 19 2018  faceit the tournament organizer deemed that the use of a programmable mouse was equivalent to running a software script hardware cheats are not restricted to mice and keyboards however in 2018 csgo player ra1f was caught using a hardware cheat that involved plugging in a second computer into his main computer the cheat allowed him to bypass esea anticheat technology and reveal the positions of all of his opponents  bug exploitation  with most video games software bugs are inevitable and individuals or teams may exploit these bugs to gain an unfair advantages over their opponents most esports integrity policies prohibit the intentional exploitation of bugs while the unintentional use of a bug may be permitted csgo has seen several instances of intentional bug abuse at dreamhack winter 2014 team fnatic exploited bugs that allowed them to stand on invisible ledges see through solid objects and become invulnerable to damage the latter two bugs were directly against the tournament organizers rules and fnatic was forced to replay the match however fnatic decided to forfeit instead at the pgl major krakw 2017 team big exploited a bug that allowed them to peek their heads over a wall without having their heads displayed on the other side and ultimately won the match big was not penalized by the tournament organizers leading to controversy over whether or not the exploit was unsportsmanlike following the match the remaining teams in the tournament agreed to a gentlemans agreement to not use the bug exploit in future matches while bug exploits are usually performed by players one of the largest bug abuse scandals in esports is the counterstrike coaching bug scandal in august 2020 esl banned three coaches that had abused a bug that allowed them to see parts of the map that they would not normally be able to see after their own investigation esic sanctioned 37 coaches in september with bans ranging from a period of five to 36months after further investigation nearly 100 new sanctions were issued by esic in may 2022  doping  similar to doping in traditional sports the use of performanceenhancing drugs peds particularly nootropics such as ritalin and adderall has been an issue in esports several countries have regulations restricting the use of peds the united states antidoping agency usada has a list of such restricted substances in compliance with the world antidoping code wada which includes ritalin but not adderall as of 2019 indias national antidoping agency nada has the same restricted list as wada however it is unclear if either the usada or nada regulations are applicable to esports athletes in 2015 professional csgo player kory semphis friesen acknowledged that the use of adderall in the csgo scene was so commonplace that nearly all players were using the drug in response to the statement the electronic sports league esl implemented antidoping policies akin to those in cycling and the olympics by august 2015 there are doubts on whether or not these regulations are effective as if they are used by a player the drugs would not stay in their system for very long in 2016 no players were reported by the esl to have been using any peds in 2020 the washington post interviewed several esports players who claimed that the use of adderall had been an open secret in the esports community for years however many leagues neither test nor prohibit the use of such drugs  ghosting  ghosting refers to a player or team acquiring additional information during a match from thirdparty sources such as stream viewers or the live audience an example of ghosting during a live match occurred in a match between azubu frost and team solomid at the 2012 league of legends world championship in the middle of their match one of frosts players appeared to turn his head and look at the spectator screens allowing him to see the positions of his opponents riot games ruled that the outcome of the match would be upheld as they stated that the incident did not affect the outcome of the match and issued a 30000 fine to azubu frost additionally riot looked at four other instances of screen watching during the world championship and determined that none of them affected the outcome of any matches another instance of screen watching occurred at the 2019 fortnite world cup finals during the match mark letw1k3 danilov appeared to look at the spectator screen which was strictly prohibited by the world cup rules danilov received multiple warnings before being removed from the match  online attacks  while some esports events take place live at stadiums with an audience most qualifiers for knockout stages of esports competitions are held online generally two teams will compete against each other through an official server and online attacks also known as distributed denial of service ddos are somewhat common in these types of matches the attack occurs when the internet connection of a player is tampered with by directing large amounts of traffic towards them causing the player to lag to the point that the game is unplayable one notable instance of a ddos attack in esports occurred during a league of legends european challenger series match between denial esports and dignitas in 2015 one of denials players experienced a ddos attack during a match forcing the team to pause the match the player attempted to play at several different locations afterwards but was subsequently ddosd each time denial was forced to forfeit the match after they surpassed the ten minutes allotted to pause a match  cheating to lose   match fixing  match fixing in esports is identical to that of match fixing in traditional sports it occurs when a team intentionally underperforms or loses a match in order to profit usually by means of betting fraud generally match fixing is done in conjunction with gambling and betting markets in the united states there are several laws and statues that provide criminal penalties for bribery gambling and match fixing in traditional sports such as the wire act of 1961 and sports bribery act of 1964 however it is unclear as to whether these acts apply to esports as many do not consider esports as a sport in the traditional sense the first mainstream instance of match fixing occurred in 2010 when the korea esports association kespa an organization that managed esports in south korea fined and permanently banned 11 starcraft players after they found them guilty of match fixing on top of these punishments some of the players also received jail time another starcraft matchfixing scandal broke in 2016 when starcraft ii world champion lee life seunghyun accepted  62000 to intentionally lose two matches in may 2015 he received a lifetime ban from kespa and was imprisoned arguably the largest match fixing scandal in esports occurred when south korean investigators announced in october 2015 that they had arrested 12 people including three players who were involved in five fixed starcraft 2 matches one of the most prominent instances of esports matchfixing was the counterstrike match fixing scandal that came to light in 2015 involving the two teams ibuypower and netcodeguides it was revealed that in an august 2014 match between the two teams ibuypower intentionally lost seven players were banned from all future valvesponsored events  spot fixing  spot fixing is similar to match fixing but as opposed to fixing an entire match a player or team will fix a particular part of a match usually in conjunction with a proposition bet in may 2022 such allegations came forward against csgo team party in regards to a 2015 match at the starladder regional minor championship cis closed qualifier  structural tournament manipulation  structural tournament manipulation is the concept of deliberately underperforming in order to take advantage of a tournament structure this form of cheating is rare and only one notable occurrence of such an event happened during the counterstrike match fixing scandal in 2014 between teams ibuypower and netcodeguides  see also  cheating in video games cheating in online games  references</td>\n",

he appeared in a slate interview discussing virtual reality headsets recommending the htc vive along with alternatives such as the playstation vr in 2019 evans built a custommade pc with components similar to the playstation 5 in anticipation for the consoles announcement the components included an amd ryzen cpu a radeon graphics card and 16 gigabytes of ddr4 ram compared to the playstation 4 pro which ran certain games in 1440p resolution at 30 hz the pc ran several games at 4k resolution at 60 hz the pc was also capable of running games at 8k resolution but with variable frame rates in

in the video in 2021 evans made a video review of a revised playstation 5 model which weighs roughly 300 grams 06 pounds less than the original console disassembling the new model to reveal that a smaller heatsink contributed to its lighter weight after testing the external temperatures of the ps5 evans noted that the new model ran at 3 to 5 degrees celsius higher than the original version and concluded that it was worse than the original as a result media outlets such as eurogamer engadget and kotaku reported on evans video also verifying that the models weight discrepancies corresponded to the changed heatsink however this led to speculation that sony modified the build quality of the ps5 in order to decrease production costs digital foundry citing evans research debunked the concerns that the ps5 models heatsink affected the performance of the console believing that it was of little concern evans later posted a video defending his arguments while clarifying his concerns with the new ps5 model he also acknowledged digital foundrys findings stating that he agreed with their article other work in 2015 he appeared on a discussion podcast with the verge reception in 2015

average precision map is among other things the current standard measure for calculating how well an object detection algorithm has performed on a certain dataset it is calculated by setting a intersection over union iou threshold standard is 05 and then performing the following calculations  for each class of detections  for each bounding box prediction calculate the following  confidence in prediction from object detection algorithm  intersection over union iou against ground truth bounding boxes of that class  based on the iou threshold calculate if the prediction is a true or false positive an iou higher than the threshold will be a true positive and vice versa   order the list of bounding box predictions with respect to confidence in descending order  going down the list of predictions calculate accumulated true and false positives  at each step calculate precision and recall according to  precision accumulated true positives  accumulated true positives  accumulated false positives  recall accumulated true positives  number of ground truth bounding boxes for that class  the step above gives the precisionrecall curve of this class now calculate the interpolated precision curve by taking the maximum precision for all bounding boxes with lower confidence  calculate average precision ap for this class by taking the area under the curve for the interpolated precision curve take average of all interpolated precision curve values  calculate mean average precision map by taking the average of all class aps as can be seen in the algorithm above map is dependent on the choice of iou threshold of note is that an map score can be calculated without averaging over multiple map for different iou thresholds as is sometimes incorrectly stated  an excel

blocks and more gato was developed at deepmind and was announced in may 2022 it is part of the trend to build generic models that can better utilizing computation in gatos design different tasks are represented as sequences a transformer neural network is then trained on the sequences to produce the final model the largest version of gato contains 118 billion parameters and the same set of parameters achieves more than 50 expert score threshold for 450 out of 604 diverse tasks ranging from dialogue generation to 3d navigation some people considered gato as an important step towards artificial general intelligence agi due to its generalizability across multimodal tasks nando de freitas a researcher at deepmind and a coauthor of the gato paper stated that to achieve agi all we need is to scale generalist models like gato and make them bigger however other people have voiced their concerns  tristan greene said that recent deep learning models like gato and gpt3 still cannot learn new things without training and therefore are far away from agi people also pointed out that although gato is able to perform a wide range of tasks it can not do the tasks as well as domainspecific models emmanuel kahembwe an ai researcher considers the hype around tools like gato harmful because it overshadows other important ai research problems gato is a general deep learning

nando de freitas a researcher at deepmind and a coauthor of the gato paper stated that to achieve agi all we need is to scale generalist models like gato and make them bigger however other people have voiced their concerns  tristan greene said that recent deep learning models like gato and gpt3 still cannot learn new things without training and therefore are far away from agi people also pointed out that although gato is able to perform a wide range of tasks it can not do the tasks as well as domainspecific models emmanuel kahembwe an ai researcher considers the hype around tools like gato harmful because it overshadows other important ai research problems  references    \n",

global governing bodies have attempted to regulate the esports space such as the esports integrity commission they have largely been unsuccessful  background  esports are individuals teams playing organized competitive video games at a professional level similar to traditional sports professional esports players are often contracted by esports organizations to compete in leagues and tournaments there is a wide variety of video game genres associated with esports such as firstperson shooters multiplayer online battle arenas mobas and sports video games some esports events pull in millions of viewers and while fans can watch esports events through broadcasts on platforms such as twitch and espn some events can be attended live at arenas prize money is often paid to the topplacing teams at these tournaments for example in 2021 dota 2 the international had a prize pool of over  with the possibility of financial gain players have an incentive to cheat  esports specific regulation  unlike traditional major league sports such as association footballs fifa and american footballs nfl esports is not centralized under a single organization while these traditional sports leagues are selfregulated and governed by relevant statutes case law and national or state regulations esports is largely unregulated in many countries esports is not recognized as a sport and therefore general regulation becomes difficult for any video game title tournament organizers generally provide their own set of rules subject to the video games developers there are two types of entities that regulate esports competitions gameneutral entities and gamespecific entities gameneutral entities such as the world esports association wesa the esports integrity commission esic the international esports federation iesf and the electronic sports league esl are entities that enforce policies over a variety of esports titles while these bodies have attempted to regulate the esports industry they have largely been unsuccessful as of 2019 esic is the leading regulatory body on enforcing ethics in esports however it is not universally adopted as leagues do not have to be a part of esic in order of magnitude they consider software cheats online attacks match fixing and doping as the most significant forms of cheating gamespecific entities are entities that enforce policies over a single esports title and are usually controlled by that games publisher examples include the overwatch league the league of legends championship series and the call of duty league  types of cheating  cheating in esports is divided into two categories cheating to win and cheating to lose cheating to win is the attempt to secure a win over an opposing player or team through illegitimate means common forms of this type of cheating are using software cheats online attacks and doping on the other hand cheating to lose is the concept of intentionally underperforming or losing a match usually for financial gain this can be done in several ways such as match fixing corrupting officials and technicians spotfixing and manipulating tournament structures    cheating to win   software cheats  esports players can gain an advantage by using unauthorized software such as an aimbot  software that automatically targets opponents faster and more accurately than most humans can most esports servers have builtin anticheat software that attempt to prevent cheating an example of a player using software assistance is counterstrike global offensive csgo player xektor who performed extremely well during german esl pro series online matches however during inperson events his performance fell off significantly members of the esl reviewed analytics from his replay data to determine that he was using an aimbot and wallhacks during the online matches and he was banned for two years his team took esl to the district court of cologne and while the court did not make a statement on whether xektor cheated or not they did determine that the measures esl took were appropriate software cheats are not exclusive to online play however on october 19 2018 csgo player nikhil forsaken kumawat was caught using an aimbot at the extremesland zowie asia csgo 2018 tournament in shanghai when a tournament administrator began to examine kumawats computer kumawat apparently attempted to brush aside the administrator and delete the hack following his team optic india was disqualified from the event and disbanded altogether esic required esl india to provide conclusive evidence of cheating and after esl reviewed kumawats play from a previous tournament the india premiership fall finals they determined had he had cheated in both events esic banned kumawat for five years  hardware cheats  generally tournament organizers will restrict the type of hardware that players are allowed to use many tournaments allow players to bring their own mouse and keyboard to an event allowing the possibility of a player using an unauthorized piece of equipment for example peruvian dota 2 team thunder predator was disqualified from the international 2018 after it was revealed that atn one of their players programmed macro commands into his mouse in a qualifying match on june 19 2018  faceit the tournament organizer deemed that the use of a programmable mouse was equivalent to running a software script hardware cheats are not restricted to mice and keyboards however in 2018 csgo player ra1f was caught using a hardware cheat that involved plugging in a second computer into his main computer the cheat allowed him to bypass esea anticheat technology and reveal the positions of all of his opponents  bug exploitation  with most video games software bugs are inevitable and individuals or teams may exploit these bugs to gain an unfair advantages over their opponents most esports integrity policies prohibit the intentional exploitation of bugs while the unintentional use of a bug may be permitted csgo has seen several instances of intentional bug abuse at dreamhack winter 2014 team fnatic exploited bugs that allowed them to stand on invisible ledges see through solid objects and become invulnerable to damage the latter two bugs were directly against the tournament organizers rules and fnatic was forced to replay the match however fnatic decided to forfeit instead at the pgl major krakw 2017 team big exploited a bug that allowed them to peek their heads over a wall without having their heads displayed on the other side and ultimately won the match big was not penalized by the tournament organizers leading to controversy over whether or not the exploit was unsportsmanlike following the match the remaining teams in the tournament agreed to a gentlemans agreement to not use the bug exploit in future matches while bug exploits are usually performed by players one of the largest bug abuse scandals in esports is the counterstrike coaching bug scandal in august 2020 esl banned three coaches that had abused a bug that allowed them to see parts of the map that they would not normally be able to see after their own investigation esic sanctioned 37 coaches in september with bans ranging from a period of five to 36months after further investigation nearly 100 new sanctions were issued by esic in may 2022  doping  similar to doping in traditional sports the use of performanceenhancing drugs peds particularly nootropics such as ritalin and adderall has been an issue in esports several countries have regulations restricting the use of peds the united states antidoping agency usada has a list of such restricted substances in compliance with the world antidoping code wada which includes ritalin but not adderall as of 2019 indias national antidoping agency nada has the same restricted list as wada however it is unclear if either the usada or nada regulations are applicable to esports athletes in 2015 professional csgo player kory semphis friesen acknowledged that the use of adderall in the csgo scene was so commonplace that nearly all players were using the drug in response to the statement the electronic sports league esl implemented antidoping policies akin to those in cycling and the olympics by august 2015 there are doubts on whether or not these regulations are effective as if they are used by a player the drugs would not stay in their system for very long in 2016 no players were reported by the esl to have been using any peds in 2020 the washington post interviewed several esports players who claimed that the use of adderall had been an open secret in the esports community for years however many leagues neither test nor prohibit the use of such drugs  ghosting  ghosting refers to a player or team acquiring additional information during a match from thirdparty sources such as stream viewers or the live audience an example of ghosting during a live match occurred in a match between azubu frost and team solomid at the 2012 league of legends world championship in the middle of their match one of frosts players appeared to turn his head and look at the spectator screens allowing him to see the positions of his opponents riot games ruled that the outcome of the match would be upheld as they stated that the incident did not affect the outcome of the match and issued a 30000 fine to azubu frost additionally riot looked at four other instances of screen watching during the world championship and determined that none of them affected the outcome of any matches another instance of screen watching occurred at the 2019 fortnite world cup finals during the match mark letw1k3 danilov appeared to look at the spectator screen which was strictly prohibited by the world cup rules danilov received multiple warnings before being removed from the match  online attacks  while some esports events take place live at stadiums with an audience most qualifiers for knockout stages of esports competitions are held online generally two teams will compete against each other through an official server and online attacks also known as distributed denial of service ddos are somewhat common in these types of matches the attack occurs when the internet connection of a player is tampered with by directing large amounts of traffic towards them causing the player to lag to the point that the game is unplayable one notable instance of a ddos attack in esports occurred during a league of legends european challenger series match between denial esports and dignitas in 2015 one of denials players experienced a ddos attack during a match forcing the team to pause the match the player attempted to play at several different locations afterwards but was subsequently ddosd each time denial was forced to forfeit the match after they surpassed the ten minutes allotted to pause a match  cheating to lose   match fixing  match fixing in esports is identical to that of match fixing in traditional sports it occurs when a team intentionally underperforms or loses a match in order to profit usually by means of betting fraud generally match fixing is done in conjunction with gambling and betting markets in the united states there are several laws and statues that provide criminal penalties for bribery gambling and match fixing in traditional sports such as the wire act of 1961 and sports bribery act of 1964 however it is unclear as to whether these acts apply to esports as many do not consider esports as a sport in the traditional sense the first mainstream instance of match fixing occurred in 2010 when the korea esports association kespa an organization that managed esports in south korea fined and permanently banned 11 starcraft players after they found them guilty of match fixing on top of these punishments some of the players also received jail time another starcraft matchfixing scandal broke in 2016 when starcraft ii world champion lee life seunghyun accepted  62000 to intentionally lose two matches in may 2015 he received a lifetime ban from kespa and was imprisoned arguably the largest match fixing scandal in esports occurred when south korean investigators announced in october 2015 that they had arrested 12 people including three players who were involved in five fixed starcraft 2 matches one of the most prominent instances of esports matchfixing was the counterstrike match fixing scandal that came to light in 2015 involving the two teams ibuypower and netcodeguides it was revealed that in an august 2014 match between the two teams ibuypower intentionally lost seven players were banned from all future valvesponsored events  spot fixing  spot fixing is similar to match fixing but as opposed to fixing an entire match a player or team will fix a particular part of a match usually in conjunction with a proposition bet in may 2022 such allegations came forward against csgo team party in regards to a 2015 match at the starladder regional minor championship cis closed qualifier  structural tournament manipulation  structural tournament manipulation is the concept of deliberately underperforming in order to take advantage of a
